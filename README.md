# Employees-OOP

The program simulates a restaurant with different types of employees, including an
owner, chefs, and waiters. Each employee has a base salary and can receive additional income
based on the profit made by the restaurant. The program calculates the salary of each
employee for a given number of months and outputs the employee statistics and total salary for
each month.
